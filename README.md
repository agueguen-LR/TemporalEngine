# Temporal Engine [![License: LGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-LGPL_v3-orange.svg)](COPYING.LESSER)

This fork of [Time Capsule](https://github.com/Xibitol/TimeCapsule) aims to bring further development
to the game engine aspect of the project. The main focus will be on the Physics Engine,
which was my part of the project, but I may also dabble in modifications to the Rendering,
originally developed by [Xibitol](https://github.com/Xibitol).

These extensions are being developed after the end of the group project,
which started on Monday 26th May 2025 and ended on Thursday 5th June 2025.

This fork is currently only being worked on by [Adrien Gueguen](https://github.com/agueguen-LR).
